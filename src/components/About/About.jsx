              I am a Computer Science fresh graduate focused on web development,
              with a magna cum laude distinction and a track record of academic
              excellence. I have a passion for coding, gaming, and exploring new
              programming languages in my free time. I have also completed
              several web development projects that demonstrate my skills and
              creativity. As an aspiring front-end developer, I find joy in
              merging art and technology, seamlessly weaving creativity into
              code to construct visually captivating and user-friendly digital
              experiences, which I believe adds value to my web design and user
              interface. Iâ€™m currently looking for new opportunities in web
              development where I can apply my skills and learn new things.
